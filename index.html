                Carmelo Kyam Anthony (born May 29, 1984)[1] is an American professional basketball player for the
                Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has been named an NBA All-Star
                ten times and an All-NBA Team member six times. He played college basketball for the Syracuse Orange,
                winning a national championship as a freshman in 2003 while being named the NCAA Tournament's Most
                Outstanding Player.

                After one season at Syracuse, Anthony entered the 2003 NBA draft and was selected with the third overall
                pick by the Denver Nuggets. While playing for Denver, he led the Nuggets to the playoffs every year from
                2004 to 2010; the team won two division titles in that span. In 2009, Anthony led the Nuggets to their
                first Conference Finals appearance since 1985. In 2011, he was traded from Denver to the New York Knicks
                days before the NBA trade deadline. In a January 24, 2014 game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Anthony
                scored a career-high 62 points, setting a Knicks' single-game scoring record and a Madison Square Garden
                single-game scoring record.[2] Anthony was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he played one
                season before signing with the Rockets.

                Anthony has played in the Olympics for the US national team a record four times, winning a bronze medal
                with the 2004 squad and gold medals on the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympic teams. As of April 2016, he was
                the US Olympic team's all-time leader in points,[3] rebounds, and games played.[4]
